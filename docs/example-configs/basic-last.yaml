# This is the most simple configuration - it will keep the five latest
# snapshots for each instance.
#
# For instance:
#
# - if you run `./lxd-snapper backup-and-prune` once every hour, with this
#   configuration you'll have backups for the past five hours.
#
# - if you run `./lxd-snapper backup-and-prune` once every day, with this
#   configuration you'll have backups for the past five days.
#
# If you seek more elaborate configurations (e.g. to keep one backup for each
# day and one for each month), please take a look into other `basic-*` examples
# in this directory.
