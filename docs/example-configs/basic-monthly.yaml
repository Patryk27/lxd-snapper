# This is a simple configuration that backs-up all the instances, keeping a
# maximum of one snapshot per end-of-day (for five most recent days) and one
# snapshot per end-of-month (for two consecutive months).
#
# Overall, it will keep a maximum of 5+2=7 snapshots for each instance, with
# the oldest snapshot being the one from two/three months ago.
#
# Assuming that today is 2015-06-01 and you've been doing snapshots daily,
# using this configuration you would end up with snapshots for the following
# days (for each instance):
#
# - 2015-06-01 (thanks to keep-daily)
# - 2015-05-31 (thanks to keep-daily)
# - 2015-05-30 (thanks to keep-daily)
# - 2015-05-29 (thanks to keep-daily)
# - 2015-05-28 (thanks to keep-daily)
# - 2015-04-30 (thanks to keep-monthly)
# - 2015-03-31 (thanks to keep-monthly)
