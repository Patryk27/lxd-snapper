# This is a bit more elaborate variant of `basic-monthly`.
#
# This configuration will keep a maximum of fourteen snapshots per end-of-day,
# six snapshots per end-of-month, and two snapshots per end-of-year.
#
# Overall, it will keep a maximum of 14+6+2=22 snapshots for each instance,
# with the oldest snapshot being the one from two/three years ago.
#
# Assuming that today is 2015-06-01 and you've been doing snapshots daily,
# using this configuration you would end up with snapshots for the following
# days (for each instance):
