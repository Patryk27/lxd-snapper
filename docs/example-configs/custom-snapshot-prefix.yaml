# To distinguish between manually-created & automatically-created snapshots,
# lxd-snapper prefixes each snapshot with `snapshot-name-prefix` (which, by
# default, is "auto-").
#
# If you want, you might change this prefix; currently there's no way to change
# rest of the formatting string though - the snapshots are always named in the
# `prefix-yyyymmdd-hhmmss` fashion.
